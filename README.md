# war

This is a website that mimics the card game war. It was built using AngularJS and the Deck of Cards API. It also uses the [fullpage.js](https://github.com/alvarotrigo/fullPage.js/) plugin to make the gameplay a little more interesting. You can play the game at http://sarah-story.github.io/war.
