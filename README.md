#War

This is a website that mimics the card game war. It was built using AngularJS and the Deck of Cards API. It also uses the [fullpage.js](https://github.com/alvarotrigo/fullPage.js/) plugin to make the gameplay a little more interesting. You can play the game at http://sarah-story.github.io/war.

###Getting Started

#####Clone the repo

```
git clone https://github.com/sarah-story/war.git
```

#####Install dependencies

``` 
cd ./war/lib
bower install
npm instal
```

#####Run a server

```
cd ..
python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000
```

The website should be running on http://localhost:8000. If you make any changes, you can run grunt by:

```
cd ./lib
grunt
```

and it will check your JavaScript and compile your SASS
